# TODO

- Hook syscall instructions, and terminate emulation on any syscall. These provide a natural stopping point, and a limit to the emulation.
- Basic block bigram diversity measure using a count min sketch.
- Maintain a Pareto archive of undominated specimens in the observation window.
- Create a channel connecting the observer to the main loop, so that a stop signal can be sent.
